## The Schrödinger Equation: Numerical Applications

There are only a few isolated cases where the Schrödinger equation is readily solvable through
analytical methods. In such cases, one must use perturbative or numerical methods to approximate
a solution to the equation. To this end, we wanted to test a variety of numerical methods on
known cases (the infinite square well and the Hydrogen atom) so that we could determine which
numerical methods are best suited for these problems.
