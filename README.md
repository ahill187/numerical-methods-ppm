## The Schrödinger Equation: Numerical Applications

There are only a few isolated cases where the Schrödinger equation is readily solvable through
analytical methods. In such cases, one must use perturbative or numerical methods to approximate
a solution to the equation. To this end, we wanted to test a variety of numerical methods on
known cases (the infinite square well and the Hydrogen atom) so that we could determine which
numerical methods are best suited for these problems.

In our project, we investigated 4 different methods:

1. Infinite Square Well: Finite Difference Method
2. Hydrogen Atom: Numerov Method
3. Hydrogen Atom: Linear Regression with Gradient Descent
4. Hydrogen Atom: Variational Method with Gradient Descent
